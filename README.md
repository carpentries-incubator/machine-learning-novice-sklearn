## Outline
As determined by the attendees of CarpentryConnect Manchester 2019, the proposed outline of this lesson is as follows:

### Unsupervised Learning
#### I. Clustering
##### 1. Kmeans
#### II. Dimesionality Reduction
##### 1. PCA
##### 2. TSNE


### Supervised Learning

All models, objectives:
- What it is;
- when to use it and on what type of data;
- how to evaluate the fit, over/underfitting;
- computational complexity


#### I. Regression

##### 1. Linear
##### 2. Polynomial
- Overfitting/underfitting
- Test sets (how and why)

#### II. Classification

##### 1. Logistic regression
- Over/underfitting can happen in regression too
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall


##### 2. Random Forest

##### 3. Neural Networks

- Evaluation
- Cross Validation

### Ethics
