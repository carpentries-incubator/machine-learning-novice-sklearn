# Linear regression

If we take two variable and graph them against each other we can look for relationships between them. Once this relationship is established we can use that to produce a model which will help us predict future values of one variable given the other. 

If the two variables form a linear relationship (a straight line can be drawn to link them) then we can create a linear equation to link them. This will be of the form y = m * x + c, where x is the variable we know, y is the variable we're calculating, m is the slope of the line linking them and c is the point at which the line crosses the y axis (where x = 0). 

Using the Gapminder website we can graph all sorts of data about the development of different countries. Lets have a look at the change in [life expectancy over time in the United Kingdom](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$state$time$value=2018&showForecast:true&delay:100;&entities$filter$;&dim=geo;&marker$select@$geo=gbr&trailStartTime=1800;;&axis_x$which=time&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin=1800&zoomedMax=2018&scaleType=time&spaceRef:null;&axis_y$domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:1&zoomedMax:84.17&spaceRef:null;&size$domainMin:null&domainMax:null&extent@:0.022083333333333333&:0.4083333333333333;;&color$which=world_6region;;;&chart-type=bubbles).

Since around 1950 life expectancy appears to be increasing with a pretty straight line in other words a linear relationship. We can use this data to try and calculate a line of best fit that will attempt to draw a perfectly straight line through this data. One method we can use is called [linear regression or least square regression](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html). The linear regression will create a linear equation that minimises the average distance from the line of best fit to each point in the graph. It will calculate the values of m and c for a linear equation for us. We could do this manually, but lets use Python to do it for us. 


## Coding a linear regression with Python 
This code will calculate a least squares or linear regression for us.

~~~
def least_squares(data):
    x_sum = 0
    y_sum = 0
    x_sq_sum = 0
    xy_sum = 0

    # the list of data should have two equal length columns
    assert len(data[0]) == len(data[1])
    assert len(data) == 2

    n = len(data[0])
    # least squares regression calculation
    for i in range(0, n):
        x = int(data[0][i])
        y = data[1][i]
        x_sum = x_sum + x
        y_sum = y_sum + y
        x_sq_sum = x_sq_sum + (x**2)
        xy_sum = xy_sum + (x*y)

    m = ((n * xy_sum) - (x_sum * y_sum))
    m = m / ((n * x_sq_sum) - (x_sum ** 2))
    c = (y_sum - m * x_sum) / n

    print("Results of linear regression:")
    print("x_sum=", x_sum, "y_sum=", y_sum, "x_sq_sum=", x_sq_sum, "xy_sum=",
          xy_sum)
    print("m=", m, "c=", c)

    return m, c
~~~
{: .language-python}

Lets test our code by using the example data from the mathsisfun link above. 

~~~
x_data = [2,3,5,7,9]
y_data = [4,5,7,10,15]
least_squares([x_data,y_data])
~~~
{: .language-python}

We should get the following results:

~~~
Results of linear regression:
x_sum= 26 y_sum= 41 x_sq_sum= 168 xy_sum= 263
m= 1.5182926829268293 c= 0.30487804878048763
~~~

### Testing the accuracy of a linear regression model

We now have a simple linear model for some data. It would be useful to test how accurate that model is. We can do this by computing the y value for every x value used in our original data and comparing the model's y value with the original. We can turn this into a single overall error number by calculating the root mean square (RMS), this squares each comparison, takes the sum of all of them, divides this by the number of items and finally takes the square root of that value. By squaring and square rooting the values we prevent negative errors from cancelling out positive ones. The RMS gives us an overall error number which we can then use to measure our model's accuracy with. The following code calculates RMS in Python. 

~~~
import math
def measure_error(data1, data2):
    assert len(data1) == len(data2)
    err_total = 0
    for i in range(0, len(data1)):
        err_total = err_total + (data1[i] - data2[i]) ** 2

    err = math.sqrt(err_total / len(data1))
    return err
~~~
{: .language-python}


To calculate the RMS for the test data we just used we need to calculate the y coordinate for every x coordinate (2,3,5,7,9) that we had in the original data. 

~~~
# get the m and c values from the least_squares function
m, c = least_squares([x_data,y_data])

# create an empty list for the model y data
linear_data = []

for x in x_data:
    y = m * x + c
    # add the result to the linear_data list
    linear_data.append(y)

# calculate the error
print(measure_error(y_data,linear_data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

This will output an error of 0.7986268703523449, which means that on average the difference between our model and the real values is 0.7986268703523449. The less linear the data is the bigger this number will be. If the model perfectly matches the data then the value will be zero.


### Graphing the data

To compare our model and data lets graph both of them using matplotlib.

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def make_linear(x_data, m, c):
    linear_data = []
    for x in x_data:
        y = m * x + c
        #add the result to the linear_data list
        linear_data.append(y)
    return(linear_data)

def make_graph(x_data, y_data, linear_data):

    plt.plot(x_data, y_data, label="Original Data")
    plt.plot(x_data, linear_data, label="Line of best fit")

    plt.grid()
    plt.legend()

    plt.show()
    
x_data = [2,3,5,7,9]
y_data = [4,5,7,10,15]]

m, c = least_squares([x_data, y_data])
linear_data = make_linear(x_data, m, c)
make_graph(x_data, y_data, make_linear(x_data, m, c))

~~~

### Predicting life expectancy

Now lets try and model some real data with linear regression. We'll use the [Gapminder Foundation's](http://www.gapminder.org) life expectancy data for this. Click [here](../data/gapminder-life-expectancy.csv) to download it.

~~~
# put this line at the top of the file
import pandas as pd 

def process_life_expectancy_data(filename, country, min_date, max_date):

    df = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col="Life expectancy")

    # get the life expectancy for the specified country/dates
    # we have to convert the dates to strings as pandas treats them that way
    life_expectancy = df.loc[country, str(min_date):str(max_date)]

    # create a list with the numerical range of min_date to max_date
    # we could use the index of life_expectancy but it will be a string
    # we need numerical data
    x_data = list(range(min_date, max_date + 1))

    # calculate line of best fit
    m, c = least_squares([x_data, life_expectancy])
    linear_data = make_linear(x_data, m, c)

    error = measure_error(life_expectancy, linear_data)
    print("error is ", error)

    make_graph(x_data, life_expectancy, linear_data)

# logarithmic Regression

We've now seen how we can use linear regression to make a simple model and use that to predict values, but what do we do when the relationship between the data isn't linear? 

As an example lets take the relationship between income (GDP per Capita) and life expectancy. The gapminder website will [graph](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$state$time$value=2017&showForecast:true&delay:206.4516129032258;&entities$filter$;&dim=geo;&marker$axis_x$which=life_expectancy_years&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:45&zoomedMax:84.17&scaleType=linear&spaceRef:null;&axis_y$which=gdppercapita_us_inflation_adjusted&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:115.79&zoomedMax:144246.37&spaceRef:null;&size$domainMin:null&domainMax:null&extent@:0.022083333333333333&:0.4083333333333333;;&color$which=world_6region;;;&chart-type=bubbles) this for us. 

> ## Logarithms Introduction
> Logarithms are the inverse of an exponent (raising a number by a power). 
> logb(a) = c 
> b^c = a
> For example:
> 2^5 = 32

{: .callout}


The relationship between these two variables clearly isn't linear. But there is a trick we can do to make the data appear to be linear, we can take the logarithm of the Y axis (the GDP) by clicking on the arrow on the left next to GDP/capita and choosing log. [This graph](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$state$time$value=2017&showForecast:true&delay:206.4516129032258;&entities$filter$;&dim=geo;&marker$axis_x$which=life_expectancy_years&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:45&zoomedMax:84.17&scaleType=linear&spaceRef:null;&axis_y$which=gdppercapita_us_inflation_adjusted&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:115.79&zoomedMax:144246.37&scaleType=log&spaceRef:null;&size$domainMin:null&domainMax:null&extent@:0.022083333333333333&:0.4083333333333333;;&color$which=world_6region;;;&chart-type=bubbles) now appears to be linear. 


## Coding a logarithmic regression

### Downloading the data

Download the GDP data from [http://scw-aberystwyth.github.io/machine-learning-novice/data/worldbank-gdp.csv](http://scw-aberystwyth.github.io/machine-learning-novice/data/worldbank-gdp.csv)

### Loading the data

We need to modify our code a little to work with this example. Firstly the data is now stored in two different files so we'll have to read both of them and combine them together. The two datasets don't quite have an identical list of countries, the life expectancy data is from gapminder themselves and includes French Overseas Departments and British Overseas Territories as seperate entities, it also includes Taiwan. The GDP data is from the World Bank and doesn't differentiate many of the overseas territories/departments and doesn't include Taiwan. Some countries are also lacking GDP data, life expectancy or both. When we load the data we'll have to discard any country which doesn't have valid data in both datasets. Missing data is marked as an NaN (not a number), when loading it we'll have to check for NaN's using the `math.isnan()` function. 

To match the analysis we just did on the gapminder website we only want to focus on a single year, so we'll filter the data down to a single year which the user can specify. 

Finally the data is sorted in the files by country name, but to help with graphing it later on we need to sort it by life expectancy instead. For this we can use Pandas `sort_values()` function to do this. 

~~~
def read_data(gdp_file, life_expectancy_file, year):
    df_gdp = pd.read_csv(gdp_file, index_col="Country Name")

    gdp = df_gdp.loc[:, year]

    df_life_expt = pd.read_csv(life_expectancy_file,
                               index_col="Life expectancy")

    # get the life expectancy for the specified country/dates
    # we have to convert the dates to strings as pandas treats them that way
    life_expectancy = df_life_expt.loc[:, year]

    data = []
    for country in life_expectancy.index:
        if country in gdp.index:
            # exclude any country where data is unknown
            if (math.isnan(life_expectancy[country]) is False) and \
               (math.isnan(gdp[country]) is False):
                    data.append((country, life_expectancy[country],
                                 gdp[country]))
            else:
                print("Excluding ", country, ",NaN in data (life_exp = ",
                      life_expectancy[country], "gdp=", gdp[country], ")")
        else:
            print(country, "is not in the GDP country data")

    combined = pd.DataFrame.from_records(data, columns=("Country",
                                         "Life Expectancy", "GDP"))
    combined = combined.set_index("Country")
    # we'll need sorted data for graphing properly later on
    combined = combined.sort_values("Life Expectancy")
    return combined
~~~
{: .language-python}

### Processing the data

Once the data is loaded we'll need to convert the GDP data to its logarithmic form by using the `math.log()` function. Pandas has a special function called `apply` which can apply an operation to every item in a column, by using the statement `data["GDP"].apply(math.log)` it will calculate the logarithmic form of every value in the GDP column and turn it into a new dataframe. We'll convert the data into two lists to simplify working with it, these can be used by the least_squares, make_graph and measure_error functions. 

Once we've calculated the line of best fit with the least_squares function we can graph it. But now we have two choices on how to do the graphing, we can either leave the data in its logarithmic form and draw a straight line of best fit. Or we could convert it back to its original form with the `math.exp()` function and graph the curved line of best fit. To allow us to do either we'll calculate both forms of the line of best fit and store them in the lists linear_data and log_data.

~~~
def process_data(gdp_file, life_expectancy_file, year):
    data = read_data(gdp_file, life_expectancy_file, year)

    gdp = data["GDP"].tolist()
    gdp_log = data["GDP"].apply(math.log).tolist()
    life_exp = data["Life Expectancy"].tolist()

    m, c = least_squares([life_exp, gdp_log])

    # list for logarithmic version
    log_data = []
    # list for raw version
    linear_data = []
    for x in life_exp:
        y_log = m * x + c
        log_data.append(y_log)

        y = math.exp(y_log)
        linear_data.append(y)

    # uncomment for log version, further changes needed in make_graph too
    # make_graph(life_exp, gdp_log, log_data)
    make_graph(life_exp, gdp, linear_data)

    err = measure_error(linear_data, gdp)
    print("error=", err)
    
~~~
{: .language-python}


A small change to the least_squares function is needed to handle this data. Previously we were working with dates on the x-axis and these were all strings which the least_squares function converted into integers. Now we have life expectancy on the x-axis and that data is already floats, so we need to remove the conversion to integers. Lets change the following line in our least_squares function to do this:


~~~
        x = int(data[0][i])
~~~
{: .language-python}

to 

~~~
        x = data[0][i]
~~~
{: .language-python}

Finally to run everything we need to call the process_data function, this takes three parameters, the GDP filename, the life expectancy filename and the year we want to process as a string.

~~~
process_data("../data/worldbank-gdp.csv",
             "../data/gapminder-life-expectancy.csv", "1980")
~~~
{: .language-python}


### Graphing the data

Previously we drew a line graph showing life expectancy over time. This made sense as a line as it was tracking a single variable over time. But now we are plotting two variables against each other and need to use a scatter graph instead, so we'll change the first `plt.plot` call to `plt.scatter`. 

~~~
def make_graph(x_data, y_data, linear_data):

    plt.scatter(x_data, y_data, label="Original Data")
    plt.plot(x_data, linear_data, color="orange", label="Line of best fit")

The process_data function gave us a choice of plotting either the logarithmic or non-logarithmic version of the data depending on which data we pass to make_graph. If we uncomment the line `# make_graph(life_exp, gdp_log, log_data)` and comment the line `make_graph(life_exp, gdp, linear_data)` then we can switch to showing the logarithmic version.

> Convert the code above to plot the logarithmic version of the graph.
> Save the graph.
> Now change back to the non-logarithmic version.
> Compare the two graphs, which one do you think is easier to read?

> # Removing outliers from the data
> The correlation of GDP and life expectancy has a few big outliers that are probably increasing the error rate on this model. These are typically countries with very high GDP and sometimes not very high life expectancy. These tend to be either small countries with artificially high GDPs such as Monaco and Luxemborg or oil rich countries such as Qatar or Brunei. Kuwait, Qatar and Brunei have already been removed from this data set, but are available in the file worldbank-gdp-outliers.csv. Try experimenting with adding and removing some of these high income countries to see what effect it has on your model's error rate.
