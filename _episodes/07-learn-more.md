# Other algorithms

There are many other machine learning algorithms that might be suitable for helping to answer your research questions.

The Scikit Learn [webpage](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) has a good overview of all the features available in the library.

## Ensemble Learning

Ensemble Learning is a technique which combines multiple machine learning algorithms together to improve results. A popular ensemble technique
is Random Forest which creates a "forest" of decision trees and then tries to prune it down to the most effective ones. Its a flexible algorithm
that can work both as a regression and a classification system. See the article [Random Forest Simple Explanation](https://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen/random-forest-simple-explanation-377895a60d2d) for more information.

## Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are a technique which tries to mimic biological evolution. They will learn to solve a problem through a gradual process 
of simulated evolution. Each generation is mutated slightly and then evaluated with a fitness function, the fitest "genes" will then be selected
for the next generation. Sometimes this is combined with neural networks to change the network's size structure. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44) shows a genetic algorithm evolving neural networks to play a video game.
